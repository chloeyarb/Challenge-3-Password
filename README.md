# Password Generator Starter Code

This weeks challenge focused on adding a generate password functionality to the JavaScript starter code so that there is an output of a random
password. To achieve this I started by adding global variables which contains arrays of the different characters that will make up each 
password. Also included are various window pop ups for the user to be able to confirm the type of characters used and length of password. This assignment allowed for both 
math.floor and math.random properties to help generate random passwords.
